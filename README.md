Show a rainy foggy window and listen to some music

## usage

Either enjoy some default futuresynth in a cyberpunk window (from the game Remember Me), or use your own.

Example: `?bg=rememberme.jpg&yt=OpYS5ATpI-U` where `bg` is the background url via `encodeURIComponent('[URL goes here]')` and `yt` is the youtube url via `encodeURIComponent('[Youtube URL goes here]')` or just the 11 character youtube video id.
